Automatic pre-processing with the SuperVectorizer
=================================================

In this notebook, we introduce the |SV|, which automatically
turns a heterogeneous dataset into a numerical representation, finding
the right transformers to apply to the different columns.

We demonstrate it on the `employee salaries` dataset.

.. |SV| replace::
    :class:`~dirty_cat.SuperVectorizer`

.. |OneHotEncoder| replace::
    :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`

.. |ColumnTransformer| replace::

.. |RandomForestRegressor| replace::
    :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`

.. |SE| replace:: :class:`~dirty_cat.SimilarityEncoder`

.. |permutation importances| replace::

Importing the data
------------------
Let's fetch the dataset, and load X (the employees' features) and y
(the salary to predict):

The challenge is to turn this dataframe into a form suited for
machine learning.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-73

Using the SuperVectorizer in a supervised-learning pipeline
------------------------------------------------------------

Assembling the |SV| in a pipeline with a powerful learner,
such as gradient boosted trees, gives **a machine-learning method that
can be readily applied to the dataframe**.

It's the typical and recommended way of using it.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-88

.. code-block:: default



    # For scikit-learn 0.24, we need to require the experimental feature
    from sklearn.experimental import enable_hist_gradient_boosting
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingRegressor

    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    from dirty_cat import SuperVectorizer

    pipeline = Pipeline([
        ('vectorizer', SuperVectorizer(auto_cast=True)),
        ('clf', HistGradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=42))
    ])

Let's perform a cross-validation to see how well this model predicts

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-100

    from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

    scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y, scoring='r2')

    import numpy as np
    print(f'{scores=}')
    print(f'mean={np.mean(scores)}')
    print(f'std={np.std(scores)}')

The prediction perform here is pretty much as good as in :ref:`example
02<sphx_glr_auto_examples_02_fit_predict_plot_employee_salaries.py>`,
but the code here is much simpler as it does not involve specifying
columns manually.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 107-112

Analyzing the features created
-------------------------------

Let us perform the same workflow, but without the `Pipeline`, so we can
analyze its mechanisms along the way.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 112-114

.. code-block:: default

    sup_vec = SuperVectorizer(auto_cast=True)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-116

We split the data between train and test, and transform them:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 116-124

.. code-block:: default

    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.15, random_state=42
    )

    X_train_enc = sup_vec.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
    X_test_enc = sup_vec.transform(X_test)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 125-129

Inspecting the features created
.................................
Once it has been trained on data,
we can print the transformers and the columns assignment it creates:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 129-132

.. code-block:: default


    sup_vec.transformers_





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    [('high_card_str', SimilarityEncoder(), ['division', 'employee_position_title', 'underfilled_job_title']), ('low_card_cat', OneHotEncoder(), ['gender', 'assignment_category']), ('high_card_cat', SimilarityEncoder(), ['department', 'department_name']), ('remainder', 'passthrough', [7])]



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 133-146

This is what is being passed to the |ColumnTransformer| under the hood.
If you're familiar with how the later works, it should be very intuitive.
We can notice it classified the columns "gender" and "assignment_category"
as low cardinality string variables.
A |OneHotEncoder| will be applied to these columns.

The vectorizer actually makes the difference between string variables
(data type ``object`` and ``string``) and categorical variables
(data type ``category``).

Next, we can have a look at the encoded feature names.

Before encoding:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 146-148

.. code-block:: default

    X.columns.to_list()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    ['gender', 'department', 'department_name', 'division', 'assignment_category', 'employee_position_title', 'underfilled_job_title', 'year_first_hired']



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 149-150

After encoding (we only plot the first 8 feature names):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 150-153

.. code-block:: default

    feature_names = sup_vec.get_feature_names()
    feature_names[:8]





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    ['division_24 Hours Crisis Center', 'division_ADA - HIPPA Compliance', 'division_ADA Compliance', 'division_Absentee Voting', 'division_Abused Persons Program', 'division_Access to Behavioral Health Services', 'division_Accounts Payable', 'division_Accounts Receivable']



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 154-160

As we can see, it created a new column for each unique value.
This is because we used |SE| on the column "division",
which was classified as a high cardinality string variable.
(default values, see |SV|'s docstring).

In total, we have 1212 encoded columns.

Feature importance in the statistical model
............................................
In this section, we will train a regressor, and plot the feature importances
.. topic:: Note:

   To minimize compute time, use the feature importances computed by the
   |RandomForestRegressor|, but you should prefer |permutation importances|
   instead (which are less subject to biases)

First, let's train the |RandomForestRegressor|,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 174-180

.. code-block:: default


    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    regressor = RandomForestRegressor()
    regressor.fit(X_train_enc, y_train)

    )
    indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]

We can deduce from this data that the three factors that define the
most the salary are: being a manager, being hired for a long time, and
have a permanent, full-time job :).
