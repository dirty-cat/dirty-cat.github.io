        "\nFitting scalable, non-linear models on data with dirty categories\n=================================================================\n\nA very classic dilemna when training a machine learning model consists in\nchoosing between using a linear model or a non-linear one.\n\nLinear models are very well studied and understood. They are generally fast\nand easy to optimize, and generate interpretable results. However, for some\nproblems with a complex relationship between the input and the output, linear\nmodels reach their expressivity limit: whatever the number of samples the\ntraining set may have, past some point, it's precision won't get any better.\n\nNon-linear models, however, tend to *scale* better with sample size: they are\nable to digest the information in the additional samples to get a better\nestimate of the link between the input and the output.\n\nNon-linear models form a very large model class. Among others, this class\nincludes:\n\n* Neural Networks\n* Tree-based methods such as Random Forests, and the very powerful Gradient\n  Boosting Machines [#xgboost]_\n* Kernel Methods.\n\nHowever, reaching the phase where the non-linear model outpeforms the linear\none can be complicated. Indeed, a more complex models means often a longer\nfitting/tuning process:\n\n* Neural networks often necessitate extended model tuning time, in order to\n  achieve good optimization and network architecture.\n* Gradient Boosting Machines do not tend to scale extremely well with\n  increasing sample size, as all the data needs to be loaded into the main\n  memory.\n* For kernel methods, parameter fitting requires the inversion of a gram matrix\n  of size $n \\times n$ ($n$ being the number of samples), yiedling\n  a quadratic dependency (with n) in the final compmutation time.\n\n\nIn order to make the best out of a non-linear model, one has to **make it\nscalable**. For kernel methods, there exist approximation algorithms that\ndrop the quadratic dependency with the sample size while ensuring almost the\nsame model capacity.\n\nIn this example, you will learn how to:\n    1. Build a ML pipeline that uses a kernel method.\n    2. Make this pipeline scalable, by using online algorithms and dimension\n       reduction methods.\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>This example assumes the reader to be familiar with similarity encoding and\n   its use-cases.\n\n   * For an introduction to dirty categories, see `this example<sphx_glr_auto_examples_01_dirty_categories.py>`.\n   * To learn with dirty categories using the SimilarityEncoder, see `this example<sphx_glr_auto_examples_02_predict_employee_salaries.py>`.</p></div>\n\n\n.. |NYS| replace:: :class:`Nystroem <sklearn.kernel_approximation.Nystroem>`\n\n.. |NYS_EXAMPLE|\n    replace:: `scikit-learn documentation <nystroem_kernel_approx>`\n\n.. |RBF|\n    replace:: :class:`~sklearn.kernel_approximation.RBFSampler`\n\n.. |SVC|\n    replace:: :class:`SupportVectorClassifier <sklearn.svm.SVC>`\n\n.. |SE| replace:: :class:`~dirty_cat.SimilarityEncoder`\n\n.. |SGDClassifier| replace::\n    :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier`\n\n.. |APS| replace::\n    :func:`~sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score`\n\n.. |OneHotEncoder| replace::\n    :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`\n\n.. |ColumnTransformer| replace::\n    :class:`~sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer`\n\n.. |LabelEncoder| replace::\n    :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder`\n\n.. |SGDClassifier_partialfit| replace::\n    :meth:`~sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.partial_fit`\n\n.. |Pipeline| replace::\n    :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`\n\n.. |pd_read_csv| replace::\n    :func:`pandas.read_csv`\n\n.. |sklearn| replace::\n    :std:doc:`scikit-learn <sklearn:index>`\n\n.. |transform| replace::\n    :std:term:`transform <sklearn:transform>`\n\n.. |fit| replace::\n    :std:term:`fit <sklearn:fit>`\n"

        "This plot shows us that for the time budget, the online model will eventually\nprocess more samples, be faster and reach a far higher test accuracy that the\nnon-online, exact kernel method.\n\nOur online model also outperforms online **linear** models (for instance,\n|SE| + |SGDClassifier|). We did not fit two online models here for simplicity\npurposes, but to train an online linear model, simply comment out the line in\nencode :code:`X_highdim = rbf_sampler.transform(X_sim_encoded.toarray())` and\nchange it for example with :code:`X_highdim = X_sim_encoded`.\n\nIn particular, this hierarchy between the linear model and the non-linear\none shows that there were some significant non-linear relashionships\nbetween the input and the output. By scaling a kernel method, we succesfully\ntook this non-linearity into account in our model, which was a far from\ntrivial task at the beginning of this example!\n\n"
